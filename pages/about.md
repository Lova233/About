# ✌️ Hi it's Me
I'm a Front-End Developer with a passion for creating seamless, intuitive user interfaces and working closely with UI/UX designers. To me, every product is like a living entity, growing and evolving with each interaction it has. These interactions shape the product and make it better over time. I enjoy the process of constant improvement, knowing that every detail matters.

Throughout my journey, I've worked in diverse environments that have helped shape my approach to development. From various talks, books, and events I've attended, I've gathered inspiration that has become the foundation of the rules I try to follow in my work. These rules remind me of what truly matters: **humanity**, **habits**, **clarity**, **communication**, and **learning from failure**.

They are not THE rules, but rather, my personal guidelines—what I aspire to follow as I continue to grow as a developer and a person. I hope they resonate with you, and maybe, you'll find your own set of rules along the way.

## 💡 Why This site is made only with MarkDown
I love MarkDown 💙

Markdown fits perfectly with my development philosophy — it's **simple**, **clean**, and **efficient**. Just like in coding, I appreciate how Markdown keeps things organized and readable without the noise. Whether 
it's for documentation, writing blog posts, or this very website, Markdown keeps things streamlined — and I love that.
