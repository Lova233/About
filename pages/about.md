## 💡 Hi it's Me

Hi, I'm Andrea Lovati, a **Front End Developer** with a passion for crafting intuitive and scalable user experiences. I love working closely with UI/UX designers, believing that the best products are like babies — 
they grow and evolve with every interaction they have. It's crucial that these interactions guide the continuous improvement of the product, ensuring it meets the needs of its users over time. I focus on building 
clean, efficient, and maintainable code that bridges the gap between design and functionality.

## 🌟 *The 5 Rules I Follow*

The rules I’ve shared here are not *THE* rules, but rather my personal guidelines—principles I try to live and work by. They’ve been inspired by talks, books, events, and even podcasts I’ve seen and heard over the years. These experiences have shaped my perspective on what it means to be a good developer and a better person.

These rules remind me of what truly matters: **humanity**, **habits**, **clarity**, **communication**, and **learning from failure**. They are what I aspire to follow in both work and life, as I continue to grow as a developer and a person. I hope they resonate with you, and maybe, you'll find your own set of rules along the way.

## 💡 Why I Love Markdown
Markdown fits perfectly with my development philosophy — it's **simple**, **clean**, and **efficient**. Just like in coding, I appreciate how Markdown keeps things organized and readable without the noise. Whether 
it's for documentation, writing blog posts, or this very website, Markdown keeps things streamlined — and I love that.
